# Z-Mail-CTF
Educational CTF game built off of Python, simulating an email system.

NOTE: THIS PROGRAM IMPORTS THE GETPASS LIBRARY FOR ITS FUNCTIONALITY.
THE GETPASS LIBRARY MAY NOT IMPORT AND FUNCTION PROPERLY ON CERTAIN IDEs OR COMPILERS,
SUCH AS PROGRAMIZ'S PYTHON COMPILER.

HOWEVER, THIS CODE RUNS FINE ON PROGRAMIZ'S COMPILER.

FOR ANY QUESTIONS, REACH OUT TO ME AT jirachi22@proton.me 

THANK YOU !
